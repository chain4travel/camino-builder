#  NFT Tickets

> NFT's are most widely associated with art pieces and nothing deeper to it. In reality, there is a wide range of use-cases in which NFTs play a role of a technology improving the industry. 
We'll create a very basic implementation of a ticketing system and show you how it works.

### Quick setup
```
git clone https://github.com/chain4travel/camino-builder.git token-gate

cd token-gate
git checkout token-gate
npm i
```

> In 'contracts' you'll see 2 files: 'TicketNFT.sol' and 'TicketBooth'.

```

> And that's it! You have now deployed an NFT to a columbus network.
