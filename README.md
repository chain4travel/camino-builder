# Build a full-fledged Staking platform

### 🏁 Prepare the environment

```
git clone https://github.com/chain4travel/camino-builder.git staking

cd token-gate
git checkout token-gate
npm i
```

[Set up your .env](setup/README.md#setting-up-env-file)

> For this example you'll need to have a KYC-verified wallet. Refer [here](https://docs.camino.network/guides/kyc/index.html) to find out how to do it

## Step 1

> 🔧 Look for staking contract in /contracts. You are encouraged to inspect it and modify it. Breaking everything will only make you better eventually.

> Compile and Deploy the contracts.

```
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network columbus
```

> 📎 After the contract is successfully deployed you'll see the address of your token in the terminal. Copy this addres to clipboard.


## Step 2

> Try interacting with the staking through a script. Modify the numbers and conditions in scripts/stake.ts

```
npx hardhat run scripts/stake.ts
```

## Step 3

> Now try calling the same script, but using a wallet without KYC-verification. You can use any wallet, just make sure it has some CAM in it. The platform will revert the call and inform the user that he needs to be KYC-verified.
