Switch the network to columbus

On the porfolio page copy your X-chain address (it should start with X-columbus)

Go to [Camino Discord](https://discord.gg/camino)

In any of the text channels type /faucet and use the suggested command by entering the address you just copied and amount you want (You are limited to 25 a day). Wait for the transaction to go through.
