## 💿 The Challenge
> In 'contracts' you'll see 2 files: 'Attacker.sol' and 'Target.sol'.  The contract of attacker is written in a way to guide towards the solution. Try to crack this case on your own. You final goal is breaking 'Target' by stealing funds. Use all the resources, search engines and magic you can find. Good luck.
