#  🍱 Front-End Integration

> In here you'll find a rough example showing how smart contracts coexist with frontend. This is not a front-end development tutorial, thus we will only emphasize points of integration.

## 🌌 Quick setup
```
git clone https://github.com/chain4travel/camino-builder.git

- cd camino-builder
- cd front-end
- npm i
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
```
